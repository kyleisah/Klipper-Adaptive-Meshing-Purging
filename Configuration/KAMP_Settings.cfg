# Below you can include specific configuration files depending on what you want KAMP to do:

#[include ./KAMP/Adaptive_Meshing.cfg]       # Include to enable adaptive meshing configuration.
#[include ./KAMP/Line_Purge.cfg]             # Include to enable adaptive line purging configuration.
#[include ./KAMP/Voron_Purge.cfg]            # Include to enable adaptive Voron logo purging configuration.
#[include ./KAMP/Bambu_Purge.cfg]            # Include to enable adaptive Bambu logo purging configuration.
#[include ./KAMP/Smart_Park.cfg]             # Include to enable the Smart Park function, which parks the printhead near the print area for final heating.

description: This macro contains all adjustable settings for KAMP 

# The following variables are settings for KAMP as a whole.
variable_verbose_enable: True               # Set to True to enable KAMP information output when running. This is useful for debugging.

# The following variables are for adjusting adaptive mesh settings for KAMP.
variable_mesh_margin: 0                     # Expands the mesh size in millimeters if desired. Leave at 0 to disable.
variable_fuzz_amount: 0                     # Slightly randomizes mesh points to spread out wear from nozzle-based probes. Leave at 0 to disable.

# The following variables are for those with a dockable probe like Klicky, Euclid, etc.                 # ----------------  Attach Macro | Detach Macro
variable_probe_dock_enable: False           # Set to True to enable the usage of a dockable probe.      # ---------------------------------------------
variable_attach_macro: 'Attach_Probe'       # The macro that is used to attach the probe.               # Klicky Probe:   'Attach_Probe' | 'Dock_Probe'
variable_detach_macro: 'Dock_Probe'         # The macro that is used to store the probe.                # Euclid Probe:   'Deploy_Probe' | 'Stow_Probe'

# The following variables are for adjusting adaptive purge settings for KAMP.
variable_purge_height: 0.8                  # Z position of nozzle during purge, default is 0.8.
variable_tip_distance: 0                    # Distance between tip of filament and nozzle before purge. Should be similar to PRINT_END final retract amount.
variable_purge_margin: 10                   # Distance the purge will be in front of the print area, default is 10.
variable_purge_amount: 30                   # Amount of filament to be purged prior to printing.
variable_flow_rate: 12                      # Flow rate of purge in mm3/s. Default is 12.

# The following variables are for adjusting the Smart Park feature for KAMP, which will park the printhead near the print area at a specified height.
variable_smart_park_height: 10              # Z position for Smart Park, default is 10.
